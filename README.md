# This repository serves for a workshop RLadies for reproducible research. 

Little bit about the dataset: 
Sequences of 16S rRNA gene were clustered into OTUs (operational taxonomic units) to reduce the amount of data. 

We have 9 individuals, that gave their stool sample every 14 days for 6 months ( 12 time points all togehter)!

We isolated whole micorbiota (all bacteria in the stool) and sporobiota ( all spore-forming bacteria in the stool).
